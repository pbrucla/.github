# 💻 Welcome to Psi Beta Rho! 💻
Psi Beta Rho (a.k.a. PBR or ψβρ) is UCLA's competetive cybersecurity and Capture the Flag (CTF) team! We are a part of [ACM Cyber @ UCLA](https://www.acmcyber.com). Whether we are pwning a binary or attacking a site using cross-site scripting, we like to have fun!

If you are a UCLA student, feel free to join us! No experience necessary!

This GitHub organization is used by us to contain our writeups, tools, and other cybersecurity projects we develop!

To see what CTFs we've recently attended, visit our [profile](https://ctftime.org/team/186494) on CTF Time.
